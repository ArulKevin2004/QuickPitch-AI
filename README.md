# QuickPitch AI ðŸ”® âœ¨

## Introduction
QuickPitch AI is an intelligent job application assistant that leverages machine learning to extract job details from career pages, match relevant skills to your portfolio, and generate a cold email to a potential employer. This project integrates Langchain, Groq, and ChromaDB to help you automatically generate tailored internship or job application emails by analyzing job descriptions.

The app provides a streamlined process to enhance your job application experience by analyzing job postings, matching them with your portfolio, and crafting personalized emails.

## What the Project is About
QuickPitch AI performs the following tasks:

- **Job Description Extraction**: Given a URL of a job listing, the app scrapes and extracts details such as the role, required experience, skills, and job description.
- **Portfolio Matching**: Matches the extracted skills from the job listing to a predefined portfolio, providing links to relevant projects and tech stacks.
- **Cold Email Generation**: Based on the job description and portfolio links, the app generates a personalized cold email that can be sent to potential employers, expressing interest in an internship or job role.
